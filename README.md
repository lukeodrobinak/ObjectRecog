# ObjectDetection
This program implements ComputerVison2 and Google's MediaPipe object detection model to recognize objects in a video live stream. 
The program is coded in Python3.11 and utilizes CV2, NumPY, and MediaPipe libraries. 

These libraries can be installed using the pip package installer for Python.
Below are the links to the respective installation guides:

[MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/setup_python)

[CV2](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)

The main file contains the executable file, and utils simply contains the visualization function.

### Execution
Simply open the *main.py* file after installing the necessary libraries, and change *model_path* to represent the location of the downloaded model. 
Then run the program and it should execute.
